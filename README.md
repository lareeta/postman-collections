# Postman Requests for Petstore API
This repository contains my learning journey on how to use Postman to make requests to the Petstore API. The Petstore API serves as a simulated pet store management server and can be accessed at <https://petstore.swagger.io/#/>.

### Overview
In this project, I explored the functionalities of the Petstore API, which is organized into three main groups: Pet, Store, and User. Throughout my learning process, I focused on creating requests using various HTTP methods such as *GET, PUT, POST,* and *DELETE*.

### Resources
Petstore API Documentation: Refer to the official API documentation for detailed information about available endpoints and request parameters.
